### ðŸ¦¯ðŸ™ŠIssues and More 
As long of this project I've had some issues and right here, I'll put the fixes.

* **Levantamiento de Estado**

  This change was made because we need to interact with the layout when we're writing information in the Form.

  1. Init the form object.
  2. handleChange made it to bring the form info to the main page,
  3. Making a copy of the form state.
  4. Giving a value to event names (this value was event value).
  5. Setting the form state.
  6. Calling setState and bring the form as object, adding their state form elements.
  7. Every event name has the value "event value".
